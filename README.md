# Code Samples

This repository contains selected code samples from real projects I've worked on. They demonstrate different aspects of software development including architecture patterns, testing strategies, and modern tooling.

## Projects

- **01-backend-nestjs-clean-arch** - Clean architecture with NestJS, comprehensive testing, and production-ready error handling
- **02-frontend-react-component** - React component library with accessibility, state management, and TypeScript
- **03-infra-docker-cicd** - Docker containerization and CI/CD pipeline with security best practices
- **04-cpp-geometry-calculator** - Object-oriented C++ with inheritance, polymorphism, and comprehensive unit testing

## Quick Start

Each project includes its own README with detailed setup instructions. Use the Makefile for common operations:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Build all projects
make build

# Start infrastructure
make up
```

## Notes

- Code has been anonymized and reformatted for demonstration purposes
- Focus is on architecture, code quality, and testing practices
- Each project can be run independently
